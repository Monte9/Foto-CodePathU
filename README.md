# CodePath Univ. Final project - *Vemoja App*

**Vemoja App** is a social app that lets you share your day through *streams* of pictures that are timestamped throughout the day/event. 

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can create a new live stream
- [x] User can add pictures to an existing live stream
- [ ] User can end a live stream to create a gif of the stream
- [x] 3 base view controllers setup
- [x] Custom UI with app logo added

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User must be able to view public streams based on location/ friends
- [ ] User must be able to edit user profile
- [ ] Super-custom UI that looks rad!

## Project Guidelines

**Requirements** of the project:

- [ ] Must have at least three separate screens supporting user interaction
- [ ] Must be data-driven with dynamic information or media being displayed
- [ ] Must use a RESTful API to source the data that is populated into the application
- [ ] Must use local persistence either through files, preferences or SQLite

In addition to these, a few other guidelines to consider given the course material:

- [ ] Projects should not require complex animation or drawing (i.e games or visualizations)
- [ ] Projects should not try to do too much given that the project should be able to be developed in just a few weeks.
- [ ] Product Evaluation Criteria

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Demo Day

Each team will showcase the project they have built and give a tour to the class in a brief 5-7 min presentation to review the work we have done over the course of the class. On Demo Day, each team will present quickly on various aspects of their projects and introduce the class to what what they were able to build over the six weeks. The presentation should include:

Title and Tagline (What is your product called?)
Introduce the Team (Who built this product?)
Inspiration (Why build this project?)
Live Demo (Show the project to the class)
Technical Challenges (What interesting technical challenges did you solve?)

Every great app starts with a concept. The best way to arrive at that concept is to consider the problem you want your app to solve. Great apps solve a single, well-defined problem. For example, the Settings app allows users to adjust all of the settings on their device. It provides a single interface for users to accomplish a related set of tasks.
An app concept doesn’t have to be completely polished or finished when you start developing your app. Still, it helps to have an idea of where you’re going and what you need to do to get there.

Here are some key questions to consider when arriving at a concept:

Who is your audience? 
Your app content and experience will differ depending on whether you’re writing a children’s game, a to-do list app, or even a test app for your own learning.

What is the purpose of your app? 
It’s important for an app to have a clearly defined purpose. Part of defining the purpose is understanding what one thing will motivate users to use your app.

What problem is your app trying to solve? 
An app should solve a single problem well instead of trying to offer solutions to multiple distinct problems. If you find that your app is trying to solve unrelated problems, you might consider writing multiple apps.

What content will your app incorporate? 
Consider what type of content your app will present to users and how they’ll interact with it. Design the user interface to complement the type of content that’s presented in the app.
