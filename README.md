# CodePath Univ. Final project - *Vemoja App*

**Vemoja App** is a social app that lets you share your day through *streams* of pictures that are timestamped throughout the day/event.

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] User can create a new live stream
- [ ] User can add pictures to an existing live stream
- [ ] User can end a live stream to create a gif of the stream
- [ ] 3 base view controllers setup
- [ ] Custom UI with app logo added

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User must be able to view public streams based on location/ friends
- [ ] User must be able to edit user profile
- [ ] Super-custom UI that looks rad!

## Project Guidelines

**Requirements** of the project:

- [ ] Must have at least three separate screens supporting user interaction
- [ ] Must be data-driven with dynamic information or media being displayed
- [ ] Must use a RESTful API to source the data that is populated into the application
- [ ] Must use local persistence either through files, preferences or SQLite

In addition to these, a few other guidelines to consider given the course material:

- [ ] Projects should not require complex animation or drawing (i.e games or visualizations)
- [ ] Projects should not try to do too much given that the project should be able to be developed in just a few weeks.
- [ ] Product Evaluation Criteria

## Demo Day

Each team will showcase the project they have built and give a tour to the class in a brief 5-7 min presentation to review the work we have done over the course of the class. On Demo Day, each team will present quickly on various aspects of their projects and introduce the class to what what they were able to build over the six weeks. The presentation should include:

Title and Tagline (What is your product called?)
Introduce the Team (Who built this product?)
Inspiration (Why build this project?)
Live Demo (Show the project to the class)
Technical Challenges (What interesting technical challenges did you solve?)
