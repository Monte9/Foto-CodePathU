## Demo Day

Each team will showcase the project they have built and give a tour to the class in a brief 5-7 min presentation to review the work we have done over the course of the class. On Demo Day, each team will present quickly on various aspects of their projects and introduce the class to what what they were able to build over the six weeks. The presentation should include:

Title and Tagline (What is your product called?)
Introduce the Team (Who built this product?)
Inspiration (Why build this project?)
Live Demo (Show the project to the class)
Technical Challenges (What interesting technical challenges did you solve?)

## Answer The Key Questions: “Get To The Point”

Many people try to get “cute” and creative because they think it will better capture the audience’s attention.  While this may make you memorable, being fundable requires a clear response to the key questions.  Everything else is just style points.

1) “What problem are you solving?” or “What is the missed opportunity?” or “What value are you providing?”

2) “What does your product do?” or “How do you solve this problem?”

3) “How will this be a big business?”

4) “What traction do you have?” or “Who are your customers?”


Every great app starts with a concept. The best way to arrive at that concept is to consider the problem you want your app to solve. Great apps solve a single, well-defined problem. For example, the Settings app allows users to adjust all of the settings on their device. It provides a single interface for users to accomplish a related set of tasks.
An app concept doesn’t have to be completely polished or finished when you start developing your app. Still, it helps to have an idea of where you’re going and what you need to do to get there.

Here are some key questions to consider when arriving at a concept:

Who is your audience? 
Your app content and experience will differ depending on whether you’re writing a children’s game, a to-do list app, or even a test app for your own learning.

What is the purpose of your app? 
It’s important for an app to have a clearly defined purpose. Part of defining the purpose is understanding what one thing will motivate users to use your app.

What problem is your app trying to solve? 
An app should solve a single problem well instead of trying to offer solutions to multiple distinct problems. If you find that your app is trying to solve unrelated problems, you might consider writing multiple apps.

What content will your app incorporate? 
Consider what type of content your app will present to users and how they’ll interact with it. Design the user interface to complement the type of content that’s presented in the app.
